    "content": "If you are working in a non-Google server environment in which default\ncredentials lookup can't be fully automated, you can initialize the SDK\nwith an exported service account key file. Firebase projects support Google\nservice accounts\n,\nwhich you can use to call Firebase\nserver APIs from your app server or trusted environment. If you're developing\ncode locally or deploying your application on-premises,\nyou can use credentials obtained\nvia this service account to authorize server requests. To authenticate a service account and authorize it\nto access Firebase services, you must generate a private key file in JSON\nformat. To generate a private key file for your service account: In the\nFirebase\nconsole, open\nSettings >\nService Accounts\n. Click\nGenerate New Private Key\n, then confirm by clicking\nGenerate Key\n. Securely store the JSON file containing the key. When authorizing via a service account, you have two choices for providing the\ncredentials to your application. You can either set the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable, or you can\nexplicitly pass the path to the service account key in code.\nThe first option is more secure and is strongly recommended. To set the environment variable: Set the environment variable GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS to the file path of the JSON file that contains your service account key.\nThis variable only applies to your current shell session, so if you open\na new session, set the variable again."
