Run interactively: codex Or, run with a prompt as input (and optionally in Full Auto mode): codex\n\"\nexplain this codebase to me\n\" codex --approval-mode full-auto\n\"\ncreate the fanciest todo-list app\n\" That’s it – Codex will scaffold a file, run it inside a sandbox, install any\nmissing dependencies, and show you the live result. Approve the changes and\nthey’ll be committed to your working directory."
