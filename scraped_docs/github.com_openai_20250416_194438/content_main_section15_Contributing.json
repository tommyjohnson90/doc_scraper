More broadly we welcome contributions – whether you are opening your very first pull request or you’re a seasoned maintainer. At the same time we care about reliability and long‑term maintainability, so the bar for merging code is intentionally\nhigh\n. The guidelines below spell out what “high‑quality” means in practice and should make the whole process transparent and friendly."
